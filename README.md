# lab_3

This projects provides a backend with 3 different endpoints, see them working here: https://postman.com/technical-physicist-83044052/workspace/lab3.
The Postman workspace is provided with a full documentation on everything it can do. Note that the web version of Postman may not work because the servers on localhost.
To run the application, you need to have Node.JS intsalled in your computer.
The first step is clone the reposetory. Then you need to type in **node stonks.js** in the terminal. After that the server should start working on 6969 port. If not, try to manually write **npn install express**
and **npm i node-fetch**, but hopefully it is not needed.

The application works with external APIs from https://api.twelvedata.com (stock market data) and https://currencyapi.com (currency exchange data). It takes data from them, processes and simplifies
for the necessary needs.
Hope u can enjoy the application!
